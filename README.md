# Project Title
**Locogram**- AI-based transportation Budget System.
The idea is to encourage people to shift from personal transport to public transport. The application is made to tackle various problems such as traffic congestion, parking issues, environmental problems, etc.<br/> The application was designed to tackle common scenarios related to transportation issues. <br>


# Project Details
 Please read the pdf file in this repository.

## Description: 
<br> Simulation Video can be found here : [Click here to redirect to video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDPMqAbJt18/)

<br/>We will be solving Economic problem which will improve lifestyle of middle class people and poor people. <br/>
The problem we are solving:
1. Help them to select best mobility assest based on their  budget.
1. Help them to predict savings per week and per month.
1. Help them to understand the delay caused by traffic infront.
1. Help e-rickshaws to navigate to places where more people will be willing to travel.<br/>

Locogram is the Android based application which will help people travel based on the budget.
1. Deep learning techniques will be essential to find patterns and features in these data to achieve a more connected transportation systems.
1. For Vehicles, 
    1. *Self-healing*: Vehicles can recognize the error with themselves and fix it. 
    1. *Self-socializing*: The ability of a vehicle to interact with the surrounding infrastructure,other vehicles and humans in natural language.
    1. *Self-learning*: The vehicle utilizes its own behaviours, driver, occupants, and the surrounding environment.
    1. *Self-configuring*: Each mobility contains digital information to identify the desired and personalized vehicle experience.
1. Using OpenCV heat map it will also tell what causing Traffic and how long will it take to clear the road. <br>
1. Navigation is done using AI pathfinding algo. ANNs can be used for road planning Traffic Incident Detection and predicting traffic conditions .

### _**" Our goal is to create a single mobile app that combines multiple modes of public and private transport to be accessed for a single flat fee. This will include driver/driverless services on platforms such as trains, cars, and shuttles. "**_

# Built With
**Expressjs** is used for *Frontend*.<br/>**Nodejs** is used for *Backend*.</br>**MongoDB** is used for *Database Mangement*.<br/>**Mapbox** for *Geographical vector tiles*.<br/>**Unity** is used for *Game Simulation.*</br>**Google collab** is used for *Data Processing*

# Deployment
No deployment as idea with video submitted on last date and team did not get selected. Lesson Learnt :relaxed:
